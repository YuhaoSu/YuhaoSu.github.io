  abstract={We develop a two-stage active learning framework for temporal action segmentation (TAS) with minimal annotations. The framework includes inter-video selection for diverse video sampling, intra-video selection for identifying the most representative frames, prototype-based TAS learning, and a semi-supervised extension. Our method achieves 95% of full-supervision performance with only 0.35% labeled frames, establishing a benchmark for active learning in TAS.},
